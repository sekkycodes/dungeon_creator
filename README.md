# Creating a Dungeon

A dungeon consists of z floors.
Each floor can have any number of rooms, arranged in a grid (x*y).
So each room in the dungeon can be uniquely identified via their x, y, and z coordinates.

A room consists of tiles, which can be floor tiles, wall tiles, or exits (including stairs).
